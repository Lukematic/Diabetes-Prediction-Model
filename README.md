# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

In this project we will try to predict if the person has diabetes has or not.

Steps for __Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering__:

    - GENERAL / GENERAL OVERVIEW / GENERAL PICTURE
    
    - NUMERICAL VARIABLE ANALYSIS
        describe with quantiles to see whether there are extraordinary values or not
        Basic visualization by using histograms
        
    - TARGET ANALYSIS
        Target analysis according to categorical variables 
        Target analysis according to numerical variables 
        
    - ANALYSIS OF NUMERCIAL VARIABLES IN COMPARISON WITH EACH OTHER
