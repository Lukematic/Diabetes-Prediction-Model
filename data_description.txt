Diabetes

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

Content

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

Relevant Information:

  Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from
  a larger database.  In particular, all patients here are females at
  least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  ADAP is an adaptive learning
  routine that generates and executes digital analogs of perceptron-like
  devices.  It is a unique algorithm; see the paper for details.

Number of Instances: 768
Number of Attributes: 8 plus class

For Each Attribute: (all numeric-valued)

Number of times pregnant
Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes pedigree function
Age (years)
Class variable (0 or 1)
Missing Attribute Values: Yes
Class Distribution: (class value 1 is interpreted as "tested positive for diabetes")
