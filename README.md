# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

In this project we will try to predict if the person has diabetes has or not.

Steps for Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:

    - GENERAL / GENERAL OVERVIEW / GENERAL PICTURE
    - NUMERICAL VARIABLE ANALYSIS
        describe with quantiles to see whether there are extraordinary values or not
        Basic visualization by using histograms
    - TARGET ANALYSIS
        Target analysis according to categorical variables --> target_summary_with_cats()
        Target analysis according to numerical variables --> target_summary_with_nums()
    - ANALYSIS OF NUMERCIAL VARIABLES IN COMPARISON WITH EACH OTHER
        scatterplot
        lmplot
        correlation
    - New Features Creation
    - Outlier Analysis
    - Missing Values Analysis
    - Label and One Hot Encoding
    - Standardization
    - Saving the Dataset
